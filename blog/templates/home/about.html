                        under which innovation, creativity and imagination can thrive whilst introducing computational thinking, science and research. For example: programming LED lights in RGB and talking about light interaction, using accelerometer
                        and gyroscope to talk about Newtonian physics. </p>

                    <p>Reimagining libraries as creative spaces where young people from the local community can collaborate on projects that explore ways to use science to make cool art. Students use skills developed in other hackingEducation sessions and are given the freedom to prototype, experiment with materials, and create expressive art. The aim is to encourage students to conceptualise their ideas and take them to fruition through a medium they are most comfortable with. This project has links to engineering, computer science, art, natural science and mathematics.  </p>

All attending students will be supported by undergraduate/postgraduate mentors and will be trained in community organising so that they are equipped with the skills and resources to independently learn and teach the history to other young people in the community. </p>
